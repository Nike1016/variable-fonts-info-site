Brochure Developer - Readme

This repo is for a site demonstrating variable fonts being wrintten and illustrated by dBerlow@fontbureau.

The editorial structure is:
1. an overview
2. Three sections
    a. Font primmer is a section on existing font format and functionality before variables, with it’s own intro page.  Does not cover all of font before variables, but covers topics that are fundamental to know, or are changing with variables. Extendable to cover more about fonts, per additional Topic as required.
    b. Variable Fonts is a section on existing font format and functionality before variables, with it’s own intro page. Each Topic in the section matches those in the primmer covers what’s changing and adding functionality  from what’s covered in the primmer.  Extendable to cover more about variables, per additional Topic as required.

(all these are written an on Google Drive:

(4-6 illustrations and graphics are still to come on this from db)

    c. Each Topic has one of more demonstrations, labled as “examples”. In the case of multiple examples in a Topic, these can be on seperate branches of the topic, or, can build a demo from smaller examples to a combination or varible functionality solving a type issue. 
       i. Topics so far are: Script, family, style, size, spacing, and contrast/background
       ii. These 6 topics have 16 examples. 
           I bagan putting text and sketches of these, all together in a single RTF on the above drive in:
