An ideal platform for multiple script fonts would, among other things, include a registered optical-size axis, and allow individual parameters of scripts (parameters that would have otherwise been designed under pressure to conform to a single font family) to vary according to the needs of the readers of a particular script. With variable-font technology, optical sizes are a registered axis; with other axes, a single file can provide for a script being used either alone or in combination with other scripts in the font, by programming parameters that can be adjusted among the scripts.
