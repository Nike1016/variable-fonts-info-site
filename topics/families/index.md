Presentation of typeface families on the desktop is based on family and style names in the font files. The operating systems and  interpret these names into menu selections for use. And on the web, typeface families and styles have been identified generically, or by file name, and then assigned properties and called whenever a run of text requires that family.

If a "font family" is just one one style, the file contains the whole family. But even if a font family contains just weights and widths, names and menus can start to bewilder minds and stretch user interfaces, at OldDreadful-ExtraBoldCondendsedItalic  And more complex families, those including extremely large style menus, size masters, "pro" glyph sets, weights, widths and italic in a the same family, have forced font developers to break the family, into sub-famiily names like OldDreadfulText-ExtraBoldCondendsedItalic for easier use via sub-family grouping in menues.
