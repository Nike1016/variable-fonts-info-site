Variable fonts, by and large, follow a file or two files containing designs of one family, where a regular or regular and companion italic each play their traditional roles. While it's possible within a variable font to change families, many of the files sizes, and interface disadvantages of the past's 'one style per file' are solved. Variable fonts containing an axis for optical sizes can be engaged automatically via the specification of size. Variable font specification can be done in web design with use of optical sizes as well as automated selection of widths via font-stretch, and relative definition for weight and other axes, referencing a single file. And this can happen without the user fussing over a single style name... Or, the user can give whatever style them they like to any instance in a variable font, and refer to it as "THE_BOLD_I_LIKE".
