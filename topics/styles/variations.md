A variable-font contains a minimum of one axis, which typically provides a fluid range of styles visually congruent to a central design, (the “default variable”). Such a font can just contain a weight axes, (wght) or like many font families today contain styles of weight and width in various combinations. The total combinations of axes define a style range referred to as the “design space” of a font family with, instead of the old discrete styles, *instances* found at every combination of the ranges of each axes.

In the replacement of existing font families with variable font families, the variable-font can contain the regular design as the default, and if the original styles are all weights, it can contain these as named instances, along the wght axis, allowing the styles to show in menus, matching preexisting styles from a variable font’s design space. 

Another variable-font file would contain widths, weights and in the same way while offering all the combinations of all the weights and all the widths as well. This may sometimes enlarge the design space of an existing font family to cover more styles that the original.

Variable fonts also allow the type developer to go beyond the registered axes, and into any number of stylistic or technical variations. Decovar shows the former, with a wide range of stylistic changes, the user can “go fishing” through for a style suitable to the tone-of-voice they may wish to present. The names and ranges of these kind of stylistic variations are as open as the creative process.

￼The font specification also contains an axis that is new to desktop and web software: optical size (opsz). And variable fonts can contain numerous  custom (or unregistered) axes, and thus styles in a design space that are also new or unfamiliar to users.

        ￼
This way, variable fonts allow type developers to add axes to adjust for the technical requirements of both composition and output, and bring fluidity to these axes in the same way wght or wdth axis brings fluidity to weight and width respectively. Amstelvar shows both the former, fishing capabilities, with a wide range of widths and weight. But the user can also “go figure”, using parametric values, measures within the type, to control specific details of the letters, and/or the white space the letters enclose and occupy.

That takes us back to some basics about variations, beginning with recognition that the default font is a particular combination of values, in Amstelvar’s case e.g., that make a regular weight and width of the family readable at 12 point. So e.g., the default, and each style on the weight axis is a combination of width and weight changes, and a little x-height change for that particular size.
