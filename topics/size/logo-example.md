The fictitious Elemeno Pea company is having difficulty spreading their brand 
across the full range of media for modern use. Being used in print to just scaling 
their artwork and having the printer over-ink the smaller uses, the thin hairlines 
that bring elegance to their pea products, is having a hard time in rendering in 
screen environments, where such elegant details ofter fail to appear.

The first instinct of their fictitious ad agency, probably based on the experience of 
doing the same thing over and over again and again from brand to brand, is to 
switch Elemeno to a simple, low contrast san serif with little or no flavor.

Elemeno instead, can now make a custom version of their logo as a scaleable font with an
optical size axis that maintains the look, feel, and elegance of their products, without the
concern for ink in print, and with control over their logo’s appearance with any rendering.
