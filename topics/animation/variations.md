title: Animation after variables

People’s first impression of variable fonts is often an animation of the stylistic capabilities of type, when for example the default of a weight axis is keyed to one frame, and the maximum of the weight keyed to another. Doing this simply is supported in most browsers. So, type and graphics can be animated, and with a little extra work, color can be added. This makes animation with variable well supported across the major platforms, responsive, scalable, hintable, and capable of using OpenType features.
