**Animation before variables

Type has a long history of being animated in film and other motion media, since frame-animation was invented. In digital form, this continued in film with ever-increasing complexity in effects. The web, soon after launch, became a platform for animation based on the GIF format and Netscape’s inclusion of software allowing frames to loop and what was called “Dancing boloney”, by web purists, brought the possibility of animated graphics and type, in the relatively simplified form, separating the responsive composition of text,including hints and glyph substitution features, from the graphics used in animation.

**Animation after variables
People’s first impression of variable fonts is often an animation of the stylistic capabilities of type, when for example the default of a weight axis is keyed to one frame, and the maximum of the weight keyed to another. Doing this simply supported in most browsers. So, type and graphics can be animated, and with a little extra work, color can be added. This makes animation with variable well supported across the major platforms, responsive, scalable, hintable, and capable of using opentype features.

**Examples:
Animate the middle range of the weight (300 to 700), and wdth (100 to 50) axes of Amstlevar l.c. o. 

Using Decovar‘s multiple decorative axes, color and CSS, Mandy Micheal created this "experimental animation" of grass growing.

Using Zycon, which contains the glyph of an animated bicyler, a character can leave its static location and appear to move of it’s own power.
