Type has a long history of being animated in film and other motion media, since frame-animation was invented. In digital form, this continued in film with ever-increasing complexity in effects. The web, soon after launch, became a platform for animation based on the GIF format and Netscape’s inclusion of software allowing frames to loop and what was called “Dancing boloney”, by web purists, brought the possibility of animated graphics and type, in the relatively simplified form, separating the responsive composition of text, including hints and glyph substitution features, from the graphics used in animation.
