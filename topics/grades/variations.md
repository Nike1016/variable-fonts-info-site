title: Grades in responsive use
---

Grades in variable fonts have the same production advantages as grades in the past for print. Variable fonts, however, allow responsive production via suggestions for use in different conditions. Grade capability in variations, unlike working for a single style, typically works throughout the whole design space. So, if a variable font has grades, all the weights, widths, optical sizes or custom variable axes, can have grades. Grades alone, or used with other parametric axes, can improve for different rendering conditions, dark mode conditions, of simple for visually stylistic variation.
