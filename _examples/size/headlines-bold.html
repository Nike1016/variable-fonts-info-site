title: Optical size in headings
description: Before digital typography, typeface families consisted of a font for each size. By the the mid-1990s, PostScript had introduced the concept that any font could scale to any size and resolution. A font format with an optical-size axis defined, as OpenType has, gives typographers the ability to trust typeface designers again and to reinvest in responsive typography with much better tools.
