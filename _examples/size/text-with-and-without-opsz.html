title: Optical size in body text
description: Before digital typography, typeface families consisted of a font for each size. Digital type, by the the mid-1990s, had seen Postscript introduce the concept of any font being scalable to any size and resolution. A font format with an optical-size axis defined, as OpenType has, gives typographers the ability to trust type developers again, to undo the “san-serifization” of typography, and to reinvest in responsive typography with much better tools.
