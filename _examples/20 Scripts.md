Example 1

Fonts today containing multiple scripts share is one set of alignments stored in the fonts that are available for programs; the baseline, ascent, descent, “cap height”, and “x-height”. Font Families that combine scripts, must select one ideal use of the vertical space of the em, meaning there must be adjustments to the scripts to make them work together. 

In the variable font AmstelvarAlpha, the Latin designers included a dozen or so Chinese characters to demonstrate a few advantages of variable fonts for this purpose. The Latin glyphs hav an extensive set of axes controlling heights and widths. The Chinese glyphs have two axes that only effect them; one for variation of height (YTCH), and the other for width (XTCH), where like the Latin, only the transparent (white) spaces are effected by the variation.
