    DESIGNING SHAPES IN AND WITH TEXT HAS BEEN<br>
    A TRADITION IN GR<span>APHIC D</span>ESIGN FOREVER. BUT<br>
    COMPOSING IT <span>WAS A LOT OF TR</span>OUBLE IN SOME<br>
    CASES W<span>HERE THE DESIRE WA</span>S FOR THE<br>
    APPEAR<span>ANCE OF TEXT TO CHA</span>NGE, BUT<br>
    CHANGIN<span>G THE APPEARANCE ALSO</span> CHANGES<br>
    THE LA<span>YOUT OF THE TEXT. SEVER</span>AL FONT<br>
    STYLES M<span>ADE ON THE SAME WIDT</span>H CAN HELP,<br>
    BUT THE U<span>LTIMATE SOLUTION IS</span> TO HAVE A<br>
    FLUID RANG<span>E OF STYLES THAT</span> ALLOW THE<br>
    SEPARATION OF TH<span>E TEXTU</span>RAL AND GRAPHICAL<br>
    NATURES OF LETTERS — IF IT COULD ONLY EXIST.
